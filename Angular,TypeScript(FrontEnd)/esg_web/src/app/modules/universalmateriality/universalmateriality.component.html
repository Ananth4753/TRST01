          <p>Air emissions include pollutants that have negative impacts on air quality and ecosystems, including human and animal health. This topic covers impacts from emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), and heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium.
            The excess gages produced which are vented or diffused from the site are harmful to societies and have the potential to warm up the atmosphere and change weather patterns which ultimately leads to the melting of polar ice caps and change in rain patterns which will impact the harvest periods and quantities.

                                        The activities of the oil and gas sector and the combustion of oil and gas are anthropogenic sources of other air emissions besides greenhouse gases (GHGs). These include SOx, NOx, PM, VOCs, hazardous air pollutants (HAP), such as benzene (C6H6) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and ozone (O3).
These air emissions can be released during production and processing; refining, distribution, and storage. They can result from activities such as flaring and venting; fuel combustion for powering machinery; and transportation of supplies and products. Air emissions can also result from evaporation losses, fugitive emissions from equipment leaks and failures, and process-safety incidents and events. A significant number of air emissions also result from fuel combustion by end-users.
Globally, air pollution causes acute health problems and millions of deaths annually by contributing to heart and lung diseases, strokes, respiratory infections, and neurological damage. Children, the elderly, and the poor are disproportionately affected by these emissions, as are local communities adjacent to operational sites.
Air emissions may lead to widespread and diverse impacts on ecosystems while affecting other economic activities that depend on these ecosystems. For example, NOx emissions that enter oceans, lakes, or other waterbodies can alter their chemistry, negatively impacting land and aquatic life. NOx and SOx emissions can lead to acid rain and increase ocean acidification. These emissions can also cause damage to plant life by, for example, impairing photosynthesis and reducing growth.

                                        In addition to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, coal is a significant source of anthropogenic air emissions classified as pollutants. Globally, air pollution causes acute health problems and millions of deaths annually by contributing to heart and lung diseases, strokes, respiratory infections, and neurological damage. Air emissions disproportionately affect children, the elderly, and the poor, including local communities adjacent to operational sites. Air pollution also causes an economic burden on communities and governments resulting from, for example, premature mortality, increased healthcare costs, loss of productivity, and reduced crop yields.
Air emissions from coal activities include CO, NOx, PM, and SO2. These emissions can occur in the form of evaporation from tailings ponds or waste areas; fugitive dust emissions from drilling, blasting, storage, transportation, loading, and unloading; refining and processing activities; transportation of supplies and products; and incidents, such as mine fires.
In addition to health effects, the emission of pollutants also has impacts on ecosystems. For example, nitrogen emissions and mercury that enter the oceans or waterways can have negative impacts on marine life. NOx is also a major cause of ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog. Sulfur oxides can lead to acid rain and increase ocean acidification. Negative impacts from acid rain and ground-level ozone include the degradation of water and soil, impairing flora and fauna of their ability to function and grow. Some air pollutants, including methane, black carbon, and ozone are also short-lived climate pollutants that contribute to climate change.
Arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, and other heavy metals are other pollutants associated with coal use. The impurities and chemical components found in coal are largely responsible for the PM, SO2, and mercury emissions formed when combusted, some of which can be mitigated by coal washing. The emissions from coal combustion are caused by organizations in other sectors, such as utilities and steel, but their negative impacts are directly linked to coal mining organizations.

                                        Animal manure also emits gases, such as CH4, N2O, and CO2. Livestock on managed pastures and rangelands was estimated to account for over half of total anthropogenic N2O emissions from agriculture. CH4 and N2O emissions have a higher global warming potential than CO2.
Fishing vessels are not necessarily optimized for fuel efficiency, further contributing to emissions. Fuels also produce localized air pollution, while the use of refrigerants to store fish products can result in the emission of ozone-depleting substances.

                                          These sectors activities can be the source of pressures on the environments in which they occur, and have direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on biodiversity in the short and long term. Biodiversity impacts from oil and gas activities include contamination of air, soil and water, soil erosion, and sedimentation of waterways. Other impacts can include animal mortality or increased vulnerability to predators, habitat fragmentation and conversion, and the introduction of invasive species and pathogens. Impacts on biodiversity can result in limitations in the availability, accessibility, or quality of natural resources, which in turn may impact the well-being and livelihoods of local communities and indigenous people. Impacts can be exacerbated when activities occur in protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value and may extend well beyond the closure and rehabilitation of operational sites or geographic boundaries of activities.

                                          Impacts can result from both onshore and offshore activities, such as land clearance; seismic testing and drilling of exploration wells; construction of assets and facilities, infrastructure, and pipelines; road development and transportation; water discharge; disposal of drilling waste; spills and leaks. Threats to biodiversity will increase as easily accessible oil and gas resources are depleted and oil and gas activities move into more remote areas.
                                          
                                          These sectors can also contribute to cumulative impacts on biodiversity. For example, activities expand into an area, new access routes are installed, which typically require clearing land. This leads to habitat fragmentation and conversion but can also result in increased use of the area, or even encourage other sectors to establish operations in the same areas, intensifying impacts. Changes to land use to accommodate the sector’s activities can exacerbate the effects of climate change if they result in removal of carbon sinks. In turn, climate change is likely to affect all aspects of biodiversity, including individual organisms, populations, species distribution, and the composition and function of ecosystems, and the impacts are anticipated to worsen with increasing temperatures.
                                          
                                          To limit and manage its impacts on biodiversity, the sectors have been developing and, in some cases already using, a mitigation hierarchy tool that helps inform its actions. The mitigation hierarchy consists of four sequential steps to reduce the negative impacts of activities on the environment. Priority is given to preventive measures starting with avoidance of negative impacts and, where avoidance is not possible, to minimization of those impacts. When negative impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, remediation measures may be used, such as rehabilitation or restoration of biodiversity. Offsetting measures may also be applied to residual impacts after all other measures have been applied.

                                          Biodiversity is essential for food production and a wide range of ecosystem services. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), biodiversity faces five major threats: habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation of biological resources, pollution, climate change, and invasive species.

                                          Agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing operations pose threats to biodiversity through air, soil, and water contamination, deforestation, soil erosion, sedimentation of waterways, and species extraction. Biodiversity generally declines as agriculture, aquaculture, or fishing activities intensify. This is largely driven by natural ecosystem conversion and habitat changes. Biodiversity impacts result in increased mortality rates of species, habitat fragmentation, and can lead to species loss or extinction.
                                          
                                          Biodiversity can be adversely impacted by monoculture. Growing the same crops or rearing the same animal species year after year may increase production but it also decreases agrobiodiversity on farms and plantations and can compromise biodiversity in adjacent environments. In crop production, continuous monocropping can result in a buildup of pests and diseases, usually requiring higher volumes of pesticides, which can be toxic to many non-target species, including pollinators. About 40% of invertebrate pollinator species, particularly bees and butterflies, face extinction.
                                          
                                          Animal production can be a major source of surplus nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, leading to eutrophication in adjacent lakes and rivers, rendering them uninhabitable for aquatic organisms. Aquaculture activities have similar impacts due to a buildup of fish excrement in waterbodies. These impacts can adversely affect the availability of fishery resources and food for local communities.
                                          
                                          Aquaculture can also result in impacts on local biodiversity through escapes from aquaculture farms, which in turn can compete with the area’s native species. Poor feeding practices can result in excess or insufficient feed for fish, adding to disease outbreaks and aquatic pollution. The presence of extra feed can attract wild fish and predators to the water column.
                                          
                                          Fishing is one of the most significant drivers of declining ocean biodiversity. This is largely due to overfishing, bycatch, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU). From 1974 to 2017, the proportion of the world’s fish stocks classified as overfished increased to 34.2%, with only about two-thirds of global fish stocks deemed as biologically sustainable.
                                          
                                          Overfishing leads to impacts on the biodiversity of marine ecosystems by altering the composition of species. These alterations result in impacts on predator-prey relationships and cause shifts in trophic structures. Overfishing can be harder to prevent in international waters, where efforts to manage stock sustainably are further complicated when fish move across country borders.
                                          
                                          Fishmeal and fish oil are rich in protein and are typically used as fish and animal feed ingredients. Fishing products used for feed can be derived from forage fish or fishing by-products, including trimmings and offcuts. Overfishing forage fish stocks used for feed increases pressure on the wild trophic structures. In aquaculture, further pressure on fish stocks can also be driven by using juvenile seeds captured in the wild.
                                          
                                          Certain fishing practices, for example, bottom trawling in areas of high biodiversity value, can damage the seabed’s physical structure, affecting bottom plants, corals, sponges, fish, and other aquatic animals. This practice can profoundly change how natural benthic ecosystems function or lead to their destruction. Seabed damage can also result in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
                                          
                                          A phenomenon known as ‘ghost fishing’ can threaten both target and non-target species, potentially killing endangered and protected species and damaging underwater habitats. This phenomenon occurs when fishing gear is lost or discarded and can continue to trap species indiscriminately. Lost or discarded fishing gear also contributes to marine plastic pollution.
                                          
                                          About 80% of terrestrial biodiversity is found in indigenous peoples’ lands and forests respecting indigenous peoples’ rights to land and natural resources can also make a profound contribution to biodiversity conservation.

                                            Signatories of the Paris Agreement have committed to keeping global warming ‘well below 2°C’, yet fossil fuel reserves that are currently available globally far exceed the maximum amount that can be consumed while remaining within this limit. This means organizations in the oil and gas sector need to establish targets for carbon emissions; modify their business models; and invest in renewable energy, technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, such as reforestation, afforestation, coastal and wetland restoration.
Transitioning to a low-carbon economy requires organizations to set emissions targets that are consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C under the Paris Agreement. Actions to reduce emissions linked to the process of extracting and distributing oil and gas, which are direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, offer important and immediate opportunities for the sector to contribute to reducing global GHG emissions. The sector also faces expectations to address other indirect Scope 3 emissions related to the use of oil and gas products. Actions to reduce these emissions can include, for example, diversification into lower carbon businesses.
Transitioning to a low-carbon economy also creates uncertainty about the future demand for oil and gas. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that based on current policies, demand for oil will level off around 2030 while, in some regions, demand for gas will begin decreasing by 2040. In a scenario that sees the energy transition accelerate to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, demand for oil could drop by almost 75% between 2020 and 2050, and demand for gas could peak before 2030. A decrease in the demand for oil and gas will translate into lower utilization of existing production facilities and decreased development of reserves. Depending on the speed of this process, some fields and facilities may need to be re-evaluated or even written off prematurely, becoming stranded assets. This will affect oil and gas organizations financially and generate significant impacts for workers, governments, and other stakeholders.
The transition may affect employment, government revenues, and economic development in regions where the sector operates. More frequent closures are less likely to be counterbalanced by openings, as has been the case in the past. Workers may face other potential impacts related to employability, reskilling, and desirable re-employment opportunities. Closure of operations without adequate provisions for decommissioning and rehabilitation may also result in an economic burden for governments and local communities, particularly in countries where oil and gas production provides a large percentage of revenues.
To achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy, the different dependency levels of workers, local communities, and national economies on the oil and gas sector need to be recognized, and quality jobs for those affected are created. Examples of actions that organizations may take to contribute to a just transition include providing adequate advance notice of closures; collaborating with governments and unions; advocating for climate-consistent policy; retraining, reskilling, and redeploying workers; and making alternative investments in the affected communities. Meaningful, early consultations with stakeholders and local communities have also been identified as crucial to achieving a just transition.

                                            Scenario analysis is a process that considers alternative situations to assess future outcomes. Organizations can use it to gauge the potential outcomes of their strategies in uncertain circumstances or conditions. Scenario analysis can employ various methodologies, qualitative and quantitative. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations suggest scenario analysis as a way to help organizations understand climate change-related risks and opportunities. 
Scenario analysis is well suited to explore the risks that transitioning to a low-carbon economy poses to oil and gas organizations because it allows them to consider alternative forms of future states simultaneously. Organizations typically define scenarios according to the speed of transition, expressed in the resulting average global temperature changes. A scenario compatible with the commitments of countries in the Paris Agreement will require a temperature rise well below 2ºC. Other scenarios can be defined according to an organization’s national context. The organization can then translate the expected reductions in GHG emissions compatible with such a temperature rise into expected revenue.

                                            coal emits the largest amount of CO2 and has the highest intensity of emissions per unit of energy among fossil fuels, burning coal is commonly the first activity governments seek to suppress in fulfilling their commitments under the Paris Agreement. The low-carbon transition has commenced, resulting in a declining trend in coal consumption. Coal use is expected to eventually be reduced by 25-90% by 2050, depending on the scenario used.
While alternatives for electricity generation exist, steelmakers currently still lack an economically feasible alternative for coal, leading to a longer transition timeline. Technological solutions for burning coal without emitting CO2 are being tested, such as carbon capture and storage. However, the technology has not progressed at the rate necessary to meet the emissions reductions needed, its environmental impacts are still to be assessed, and new investment remains scarce.
The energy transition presents high risks for organizations, workers, and local communities reliant on coal activities. As the market for coal shrinks, some organizations will be forced to close operations, which may have an impact on their financial viability. Organizations are at risk of owning stranded assets or pieces of physical capital that become drastically reduced in value by the transition, leading to write-offs.
Organizations may mitigate these risks by diversifying away from coal, investing in technological solutions, driving innovation through collaborative sectoral partnerships, and focusing on market segments expected to remain operational for longer. However, selling existing coal assets to other entities to reduce the organization’s GHG emissions, instead of closing operations, can be detrimental to climate change mitigation efforts. Offloading coal assets to organizations that continue to extract coal do not reduce overall emissions but can instead result in increased emissions. If the organization shifts closure and rehabilitation responsibilities to less accountable and inexperienced operators, this may also weaken the management of environmental and socioeconomic impacts resulting from eventual closure.
The transition to a low-carbon economy may affect employment, government revenues, and economic development in regions where the sector operates. More frequent closures are less likely to be counterbalanced by openings, as has been the case in the past. Workers may face issues related to employability, reskilling, and desirable re-employment opportunities. The lack of adequate provisions for closure and rehabilitation may also result in an economic burden for governments and local communities, particularly in countries where coal production provides a large percentage of revenues.
To achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy, the different dependency levels of workers, local communities, and national economies on the coal sector need to be recognized.

Meaningful, early consultations with stakeholders and local communities have also been identified as crucial to achieving a just transition. The transition can also bring opportunities to reinvigorate economic activity and provide new employment opportunities and skills development.

                                              Small-scale producers – farmers and fishers, who grow, harvest, and supply products to organizations – are key suppliers for the agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing sectors. There are 500 million smallholder farmers in the agriculture sector, and in some regions, they produce up to 80% of all agricultural products. Similarly, small fishing vessels represent over 80% of the world’s total fishing fleet. However, many of these farmers and fishers live in poor and rural areas, where communities face economic and social exclusion due to inadequate infrastructure, lack of technology, limited production capacity, or limited access to markets and finance.

                                              Farmers' and fishers' productivity and resilience can be strengthened by sustained demand, capital provision, skill building, and enhanced access to markets. For example, contract farming – when an organization enters into forwarding agreements to purchase products – can enhance farmers' financial certainty and market access. Organizations may also commit to providing production inputs as part of these agreements, such as seeds and fertilizers. However, contract farming agreements need to be executed in a way to prevent debt or dependency.
                                              
                                              Agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing organizations can also contribute to the capacity of small-scale producers by reducing barriers to market and connecting them to financial services and productive assets. Organizations may also facilitate the formalization and development of business enterprises by farmers and fishers. This includes assistance with registering land titles, business registration, and formal labor relations. Organizations can also encourage cooperatives that provide collective benefits.
                                              
                                              Economic inclusion can also be encouraged when organizations select suppliers by, for example, prioritizing those owned by women or members of other vulnerable groups. Empowering women is a key driver for economic inclusion in rural areas, as women are more likely to be in poverty and face economic constraints at the individual or household levels.
                                              
                                              The development of infrastructure that extends beyond the scope of the organization’s operations, such as roads, ports, or canals, can facilitate access to transportation, energy, sanitation, and other services in otherwise unserved areas. Organizations may also contribute to community investments and stimulate economic activity in the local area, providing economic opportunities for those not active in the local economy.
                                              
                                              Empowering farmers and fishers can help them achieve high productivity and contribute to greater food security, responding to current and future needs of sustainable food production.

                  <p> Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions comprise air emissions that contribute to climate change, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). This topic covers direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions related to an organization’s activities, as well as other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions that occur upstream and downstream of the organization’s activities.
                    GHG emissions are the single biggest contributor to climate change, the impacts of which are occurring at an accelerating rate. Studies show that approximately half of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions since 1750 have occurred in the last 40 years, mostly due to the increased use of fossil fuels.

                                                The oil and gas sector’s activities and the use of oil and gas products are responsible for a large portion of two major GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Globally, it is estimated that the sector is responsible for a quarter of all anthropogenic emissions of CH4, which has a notably higher global warming potential than CO2. Recent measurements indicate that available figures on CH4 emissions from the sector could be underestimated. Other GHGs from oil and gas activities include ethane (C2H6), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HCFs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
                                                GHG emissions from oil and gas activities are classified as direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in the case of activities owned or controlled by the organization or energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in the case of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organization. Currently, 15% of the world’s energy-related GHG emissions come from the process of producing and distributing oil and gas.
                                                Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions comprise emissions from fuel combustion during production, process emissions such as those during loading and tankage, and fugitive emissions such as those from piping and equipment leaks. A substantial source of the sector’s Scope 1 GHG emissions is flaring and venting, which aim to dispose of gas that cannot be contained or handled otherwise for safety, technical, or economic reasons. These practices occur during oil and gas production, storage, and refining. [When gas needs to be disposed of, it may be flared (burned off), or vented (released without being burned). Flaring converts gas to CO2, while venting releases CH4 directly to the atmosphere. Given that CH has a higher global warming potential than CO2, routing associated gases to an efficient flare system instead of venting is considered the best practice and there is wide agreement that routine venting should be eliminated.]
                                                Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions originate from stationary and mobile sources (e.g., transportation of materials, products, or waste); and the activities of extraction; oil refining; liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; and operation of facilities and equipment. The depletion of traditional oil and gas resources has led the sector to move production to more difficult settings, which may involve more complex extraction methods such as offshore deep-water drilling or oil sand mining. Despite the sector’s ongoing improvements in production efficiency, these conditions are likely to increase the amount of energy used during production and transportation and, as such, GHG emissions associated with these activities.
                                                For the oil and gas sector, other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, constitute the most significant GHG emissions and over half of global CO2 emissions. The majority of Scope 3 GHG emissions originate from combustion processes related to construction, electricity and heat generation, manufacturing, and transportation. Volumes of these emissions have increased together with higher energy demands.

                                                For coal, end-use activities are responsible for the most significant GHG emissions, classified as other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions. These emissions mostly originate from electricity and heat generation, steel production, and cement manufacturing. Of all energy sources, coal has the highest emissions intensity when combusted, and is the single largest source of global CO2 emissions. Thermal coal, which is mainly used for electricity generation, typically releases more than twice the amount of GHGs than natural gas per unit of electricity produced. Steel production uses metallurgical coal, with three-quarters of the energy demand being met by coal. Emissions from the iron and steel industry represent around 7% of the global total CO2 emissions from energy.
                                                Coal mining activities also consume significant amounts of energy. Unless renewable energy sources provide the necessary power, mining operations generate CO2 emissions. These are classified as direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in the case of activities owned or controlled by the organization; and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in the case of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organization.
                                                The amount of energy used in coal mining and the resulting CO2 emissions depend on several factors, such as the method of mining, mine depth, geology, mine productivity, and degree of refining required. The most energy-consuming activities include transportation, exploration, drilling, excavation, extraction, grinding, crushing, milling, pumping, and ventilation. Extraction and transportation in underground mines might require more energy than surface mining due to, for example, greater requirements for hauling, ventilation, and water pumping. The use of explosives for blasting, mine fires, and other incidents, and closure and rehabilitation activities are also sources of GHG emissions.
                                                Besides CO2, coal operations also cause the emission of methane (CH4). This GHG has a significantly higher global warming potential than CO2; when considering its impact over 100 years, one ton of CH4 is equivalent to 28 to 36 tons of CO2. Coal mining is estimated to be responsible for 11% of global anthropogenic CH4 emissions, although recent measurements indicate that CH4 emissions from energy production could be underestimated.
                                                CH4 emissions from coal mines are released into the atmosphere during and after the mining process. Coal mine methane (CMM) can be released via degasification systems and ventilation air from underground coal mines. CMM can also be released through seepage from abandoned or closed mines through vent holes or cracks in the ground, coal seams of surface mines, and fugitive emissions from storage and transportation. Underground mines are responsible for most of direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions from CH4 due to the higher gas content of deeper seams.
                                                Other GHG emissions related to coal extraction and use include nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

                                                Emissions into the air, including greenhouse gas (GHG), ozone-depleting substances (ODS), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOX), and other significant air emissions are regarded as pollutants. Emissions can have negative impacts on air quality, ecosystems, and on human and animal health. GHG emissions are also a major contributor to climate change.
Agriculture is responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. From 2007 to 2016, the sector accounted for approximately 13% of carbon dioxide (CO2), 44% of methane (CH4), and 82% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from human activities globally, which was 23% of the total net anthropogenic emissions of GHGs over this period.
In agriculture and aquaculture, the highest share of total emissions is associated with land use change, including the conversion of land from a natural ecosystem for use by the sectors. Forests contribute to the reduction of CO2 by absorbing more carbon than they release, making them a carbon sink. Clearing forests or grasslands results in large amounts of CO2 being released. Soils can also absorb greenhouse gas emissions. Soil and pasture management practices can contribute to the capacity of soil to store carbon or adversely accelerate the release of carbon from the soil into the atmosphere. Restoring and preserving carbon sinks, such as natural ecosystems and soils, plays an integral role in mitigating climate change.
Land management for crop production produces GHG emissions through soil cultivation, including tillage, crop residue decomposition, and burning vegetation and crop residues. This results in the production of CO2, N2O, and particulate matter. Fertilizers, pesticides, and fuels used to power machinery and vehicles also release GHG emissions.
Ruminant livestock produces GHG emissions during respiration and digestion. Animal manure also emits gases, such as CH4, N2O, and CO2. Livestock on managed pastures and rangelands was estimated to account for over half of total anthropogenic N2O emissions from agriculture. CH4 and N2O emissions have a higher global warming potential than CO2.
In animal production and aquaculture, emissions are also associated with animal and fish feed sourcing. These emissions can be caused by natural ecosystem conversion and the feed's production, processing, and transportation. In aquaculture land-based farms, emissions are also released from the combustion of fuel to generate the energy needed to regulate water temperature and circulation.
Fishing activities produce emissions from burning fuels, such as diesel, marine fuel oils, and intermediate fuel oils. These fuels provide the power to fishing vessels to access marine stocks and power onboard fish processing facilities, including freezing or refrigerating fish. Fishing vessels are not necessarily optimized for fuel efficiency, further contributing to emissions. The combustion of fuels also produces localized air pollution, while the use of refrigerants to store fish products can result in the emission of ozone-depleting substances.
The goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C requires organizations to set emissions targets consistent with the cumulative carbon budgets that set a cap for the total allowed CO2 emissions.
Reducing emissions for the sectors includes measures that help mitigate the main sources of GHGs, for example, measures to reduce methane (CH4) emitted by ruminants through better management of feed and manure, or in crop production, using culture-specific production practices, such as growing rice using alternate wetting and drying methods that reduce methane production.

                                                  Oil and gas activities typically generate high volumes of waste, including hazardous waste. The largest waste streams derive from the extraction or processing of oil and gas and can consist of drilling muds and cuttings, scale, and sludges, which in turn, can contain chemical additives, hydrocarbons, metals, naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and salts. These waste streams may contaminate surface water, groundwater, seawater with chemicals or heavy metals, and negatively impact plant and animal species as well as human health. Impacts can depend on an organization’s approach to waste management, regulation, and on availability of recovery and disposal facilities in the proximity of activities.

                                                  Waste streams that cannot be reduced, or diverted from disposal, are typically stored, treated or disposed through various methods. When disposed of in underground injection wells, drilling waste can trigger seismicity or lead to groundwater contamination. In some offshore operations, drilling fluids might also be discharged into waterways or the ocean, depending on regulation and the availability of alternative outlets. If waste is disposed of on land or if
                                                  hazardous substances from waste storage facilities leach into the ground, other impacts can include contamination of land, loss of land productivity, and erosion. In remote areas with limited recovery and disposal methods, waste impacts can be more severe or harder to monitor.
                                                  
                                                  In oil sands mining, the largest waste stream is tailings, a hazardous waste stream produced during the process of separating oil from sand. Some tailings ponds have been found to leach chemicals, causing health risks for local communities and wildlife.
                                                  
                                                  When operations end, closure and rehabilitation activities usually involve the final disposal of hazardous chemicals and managing substantial quantities of materials from disused structures or equipment. Other typical wastes from oil and gas activities include waste oils, construction waste, and domestic and office waste.
                                                  
                                                  Use of materials
                                                  The type and quantity of materials used by an organization in the oil and gas sector can signify its dependence on natural resources and its impacts on their availability. Related environmental impacts depend on the organization’s approach to sourcing, use, and disposal of these materials. Oil and gas extraction, development, production, and processing activities represent a large proportion of the sector’s use of materials. Concrete, cement, steel and other metals are necessary to construct offshore platforms and onshore facilities, as well as for the equipment and infrastructure needed to extract, process and transport oil and gas (e.g., valves, tubing and pipelines). Large volumes of chemicals are used during drilling and well completion.
                                                  
                                                  The oil and gas sector has opportunities for efficient use of materials. These include using its significant purchasing power to create demand for more responsibly produced materials or implementing circularity measures that aim at reusing or recycling materials from disused structures, such as steel and concrete.

                                                  Coal activities typically generate high volumes of waste, including hazardous waste. The largest waste streams derive from the extraction or processing of coal and comprise overburden, rock waste, and tailings. These waste streams can also contain toxic or noxious substances, including heavy metals. They may contaminate surface water, groundwater, seawater, and food sources, and have negative impacts on plant and animal species as well as human health. Further effects can be loss of land productivity and erosion. The severity of impacts can depend on an organization’s approach to waste management, regulation, and the availability of recovery and disposal facilities near coal activities.

                                                  Overburden from surface mining is usually stored on adjacent land until it can backfill the pit once mining is complete. Disposal options are limited for some surface mining techniques, such as mountain-top removal since the overburden cannot be returned to the pit. In these cases, the disposal method consists of adjacent valley filling, leading to impacts such as the burial of waterways and concentration of noxious substances harmful to ecosystems and humans.
                                                  
                                                  Coal tailings slurry, a residual waste generated by coal processing, is often discarded into ponds, filtered, stored in heaps, or disposed of in underground voids. Surface tailings storage facilities contained by tailings dams can cover vast areas. Tailings without harmful substances can be drained from the facility and then reshaped, covered with soil, and vegetated. However, tailings pose a health risk for local communities when they contain heavy metals, cyanide, chemical-processing agents, sulfides, or suspended solids that pollute the environment, including groundwater and surface water
                                                  
                                                  Rock waste and coarse tailings are usually managed on heaps or disposed of in constructed waste rock dumps or former open-pit operations. Further environmental impacts from rock dumps include dust that can be carried by wind or rainwater, affecting air quality, watercourses, or lands.
                                                  
                                                  The nature and quantity of waste generated often requires management beyond the productive phase of a mining operation. At the end of a coal exploration or extraction project, closure can yield significant waste with lasting environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Other typical wastes from coal operations include waste oils and chemicals, spent catalysts, solvents, other industrial wastes, and packaging and construction wastes.

                                                  Waste from organizations in the agriculture, aquaculture, and fishing sectors includes organic waste, such as crop waste, animal manure, fish faeces, and animal carcasses; and inorganic waste, such as plastics. It can also include hazardous waste, such as pesticide containers, and materials from animal health products.
Some organic by-products have the potential to be used as a biomass energy source, feed, or fertilizers, contributing to circularity measures. However, if incinerated without energy recovery or directed to landfills, by-products turn into waste and cause negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water pollution. In addition, organic waste from terrestrial and aquatic animals may contain microorganisms and parasite eggs. These pathogens can spread in receiving environments and cause ill health in humans.
In aquaculture operations, pollution and waste impacts from fish faeces and settleable solids can be minimized through water management. Aquaculture activities generate considerable amounts of plastic waste. Plastics are widely used for equipment, disposable gloves, and for packaging various inputs, such as feed sacks and wrapped consumables. Plastic can also be used in pond liners, harvest nets, pipework, buoys, ropes, incubation jars, and containers. In fishing, various marine tools, such as floats, fishing nets and lines, strapping bands, wire ropes, and sails, also consist of plastics. Discarded or abandoned plastic waste can contaminate the surrounding environments and enter the ocean and other water bodies. Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear contributes to waste and overfishing. Fish and aquatic animals sometimes mistake plastic waste for food and get trapped in items such as ropes, nets, and bags. The management of waste generated onboard fishing vessels, including plastics, paper products, food waste, and chemicals, is regulated by international maritime standards. Incorrectly disposed waste from agriculture, aquaculture and fishing activities can have lasting impacts on receiving environments, causing long-term contamination of soil and water. Contamination of agricultural land and natural resources causes negative impacts on the health and safety of local communities and can impact the safety of food produced.
These waste streams from various industries may contaminate surface water, groundwater, and seawater with chemicals or heavy metals, and negatively impact plant and animal species as well as human health. The severity of impacts can depend on an organization’s approach to waste management, regulation, and the availability of recovery and disposal facilities.  Further effects can be loss of land productivity and erosion.  Impacts can depend on an organization’s approach to waste management, and regulation, and on the availability of recovery and disposal facilities in the proximity of activities.

                                                    Oil and gas activities can reduce water availability for local communities and other sectors that also rely on the resource. They can have impacts on the quality of surface water, groundwater, and seawater, which can translate into long-term impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, cause health and development problems for humans, and impair food security.
                                                    Extraction and processing are the oil and gas sector activities that use the largest volumes of water. The quantity of water required varies according to the oil and gas extraction method, local geology, and the degree of processing required. Some extraction or processing methods, including hydraulic fracturing and oil sand mining, are particularly water intensive. Oil and gas organizations may also need to manage large quantities of produced water or process wastewater, which typically contains hydrocarbons, chemicals, or other hazardous substances. To minimize water impacts, produced water and process wastewater may be reinjected for good stimulation or reused in other processes. If not, they may be discharged to surface water, groundwater, seawater, or a third party; dispersed over land; or stored in evaporation ponds. Contamination can also result from the injection of drilling fluids into wells and flow back from hydraulic fracturing. Inefficient treatment of water discharges, oil spills from transportation accidents, ruptured pipelines or seepage, or failure of an oil sands tailings dam can also have similar impacts on water quality.
                                                    A large proportion of the world’s oil and gas resources are found in areas that are arid or experience water stress. In such areas, the sector’s activities are likely to increase competition for water in demand for other uses – such as for household use and fishing, aquaculture, or agricultural activities. This may exacerbate tensions between, as well as within, sectors or local communities. Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events related to climate change will likely pose more frequent challenges related to water availability and quality in the future.

                                                    Coal activities can reduce water availability for local communities and other sectors that rely on water. They can have impacts on the quality of surface water, groundwater, and seawater, which can translate into long-term impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, cause health and development problems for humans, and impair food security. Water is used in coal activities for cooling and cutting; dust suppression during mining and hauling; washing to improve coal quality; re-vegetation of surface mines; and long-distance coal slurry transportation. The amount of water needed for activities depends on whether mining occurs on the surface or underground and on operational efficiency. A large proportion of the world’s coal resources are found in areas that are arid or experience water stress. In such areas, the sector’s activities are likely to increase competition for water. This may exacerbate tensions between, as well as within, sectors or local communities. Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events due to climate change will likely pose more frequent challenges to water availability and quality in the future. Coal activities’ impacts on water quality can be due to leaching from tailings, failure of tailings facilities, and acid mine drainage containing acidic water and heavy metals. Certain mining methods can involve substantive vegetation clearance and land-use changes, leading to erosion and sediment flows, which together with alterations in water flows can affect water quality and aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Underground operations might also disrupt or contaminate aquifers. Transportation accidents and related coal spills can contaminate waterways and wetlands with harmful materials, such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and sulphur compounds.

                                                    Water is a critical input for crop and animal production, as well as aquaculture. The agriculture sector accounts for an estimated 70% of total water withdrawn globally. Water has critical importance to agricultural productivity. On average, irrigated land is twice as productive per unit as non-irrigated land. Irrigation can be achieved through different methods, including surface irrigation or subsurface irrigation. Water can be withdrawn from groundwater or surface water, such as lakes and reservoirs, or come in the form of treated wastewater or desalinated water. Intensive water withdrawal can decrease aquifer levels, which reduces the long-term sustainability of water resources and increases access costs for all users. In animal production, water is used for animal hydration and cleaning, washing & sanitization of milking and slaughter equipment used to process animal products. Effluents containing waste from terrestrial animals, fertilizers, and pesticides can contribute to the pollution of surface and groundwater. Aquaculture water use is associated with raising aquatic organisms in the water and can require a significant amount of surface water. Aquaculture production occurs in ponds, artificial channels, and, to a lesser extent, closed-recirculation tanks. Because aquaculture operations take place in controlled environments, much of the water withdrawn can be returned to the source after use. Nutrient build-up from discharges in water bodies near fish farms is a typical water impact from aquaculture production. This issue is exacerbated in high-density farms when fish faeces discharged into water potentially deplete oxygen levels and create algal blooms that lead to eutrophication. The eutrophication and acidification of water results in negative impacts on biodiversity. In fishing operations, wastewater can be discharged to the sea from fishing vessels, which can contain fish waste from gutting and bleeding, as well as materials and coating from the hold and onboard refrigeration systems. Wastewater could also come from cleaning holds and machinery containing detergents, disinfectants, and oily mixtures. Discharges can cause oxygen depletion in seawater and pollution in coastal areas.

                                                      Oil and gas facilities can continue to generate environmental impacts after closure, including soil and water contamination, changes to landforms, and disturbance of biodiversity and wildlife. Closure can also lead to lasting impacts on local communities. Failure to close facilities and rehabilitate sites effectively can render land unusable for other productive purposes and can result in health and safety hazards due to contamination or to the presence of hazardous materials.

                                                      Closure and rehabilitation of oil and gas fields can include removal and final disposal of hazardous substances and chemicals; capping or plugging abandoned wells; dismantling structures and reusing, recycling or disposing materials. It can also include the management of waste; surface water and groundwater quality issues resulting from spills and leaks; and restoration of lands to a condition or economic value equivalent to the pre-development state. Closing oil sands mining sites also involves managing tailings ponds.
                                                      
                                                      Several international conventions require decommissioning and removing all offshore structures at the end of field life. However, these requirements may be subject to different interpretations across countries, where national regulations or regional conventions can take precedence over international conventions. As a result, organizations in the oil and gas sector may lack clear rules for filing decommissioning plans with local governments and taking action on them once offshore structures become disused.
                                                      
                                                      Decommissioning and dismantling offshore structures can be costly and complex due to their size, weight, and location. There may be additional complexities and environmental considerations when, for example, structures that should be removed become part of benthic communities and habitats. In some cases, decommissioning can occur in situ and structures may be left in place. When this happens, impacts can include marine pollution from corrosion, ecosystem changes, damage to fishing equipment, and navigational hazards to shipping.
                                                      
                                                      The closure and rehabilitation phase may offer additional employment opportunities to local communities. However, once this phase is completed, workers may be retrenched and local communities may face economic downturn and social disruption if they have come to depend on the oil and gas sector’s activities for employment as well as for income, taxes and other payments to governments, community development, and other benefits.
                                                      
                                                      To anticipate potential impacts, planning for closure often requires planning in the early phases of a project. Impacts from closure can be exacerbated if there is insufficient notice or lack of adequate planning for economic revitalization, social protection, and labor transition. Without clearly assigned responsible parties or allocated funds, closed oil and gas facilities can leave a legacy of environmental issues and financial burdens for communities and governments. The need to reduce GHG emissions and to transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to lead to more frequent closures. These are less likely to be counterbalanced by openings, as has been the case in the past. Collaboration between local and national governments and organizations, as well as with workers and unions, is necessary to mitigate significant impacts and ensure a just transition.

                                                      Following the closure of coal mines, potential environmental impacts include soil and water contamination, changes to landforms, and disturbance of biodiversity and wildlife. Closure can also lead to lasting socioeconomic consequences for local communities. Preparation for and implementation of responsible closure is becoming increasingly important for the coal sector due to the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the transition to a low-carbon economy.
This urgency will lead to more frequent and earlier closures of coal activities.

Impacts from closure can differ between surface and underground mining. For example, surface mining requires more land use and substantial rehabilitation, whereas abandoned underground mines may emit coal mine methane even after active mining has ceased, making an ongoing contribution to GHG emissions. 

Closure often requires planning already in the early phases of a project’s life cycle to anticipate potential impacts, including impacts on local communities and their livelihoods. Closure and rehabilitation activities can include:
•	stabilization of open-pit or underground workings, such as landfilling to prevent subsidence;
•	removal or conversion of infrastructure to ensure the safety of people;
•	rehabilitation of waste rock stockpiles and tailings facilities to control erosion and land degradation; 
•	management of waste, surface water, and groundwater quality issues resulting from abandoned mine drainage, waste rock, and leaching from tailings and
•	post-closure environmental and socio-economic monitoring.
Once complete, closure and rehabilitation of operational sites should result in a stable and sustainable ecosystem compatible with planned post-closure land use that considers the needs of local stakeholders. Failure to close assets and rehabilitate sites effectively can render land unusable for other productive uses and can result in health and safety hazards due to contamination or the presence of hazardous materials.
Impacts from closure can be exacerbated if there is insufficient notice or lack of adequate planning for economic revitalization, social protection, and labor transition. Without clearly assigned responsible parties or allocated funds, closed coal facilities can leave a legacy of environmental issues and financial burden for communities and governments.

However, the closure and rehabilitation phase may also offer additional employment opportunities. This can involve an influx of additional workers for an extended period, potentially exacerbating other environmental pressures. Once this phase is completed, workers may be retrenched and local communities face economic downturns and social disruption. This is especially relevant for those communities that depend on the coal sector for employment, income, taxes and other payments, community development, and other benefits.

A collaboration between local and national governments, coal organizations, workers, and unions are essential to mitigate negative impacts and ensure a just transition that enables decent jobs, social inclusion and economic opportunities while transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Examples of actions organizations may take include offering early retirement, reskilling, retraining, worker transfer programs, and relocation assistance programs.
