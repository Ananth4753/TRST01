                        A significant portion of a company’s carbon emissions originates from its supply chain, often surpassing the direct emissions from its core operations. According to a study by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), supply chain emissions are, on average, 11.4 times greater than a company’s direct emissions. This revelation emphasizes the need to focus on supply chain carbon footprints to combat climate change meaningfully.

                          The supply chain carbon footprint involves the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced at every product’s life cycle phase. This covers everything from raw material extraction to manufacturing, transportation, usage, and finally, disposal or recycling. The aim is to account for all direct and indirect carbon emissions associated with a product or service. These emissions, quantified using carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), allow us to compare various GHGs based on their global warming potential (GWP).

                        In an increasingly interconnected and informed world, sustainability is fast becoming the crux of successful businesses. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) has emerged as a significant component of an organization’s health and success, bringing these aspects of business operations into sharp focus. The ESG Scorecard Model, a tool designed to assess an organization’s ESG performance, has become increasingly prevalent.

                        Understanding the ESG Scorecard Model : 
                      </h2>

                      <p class="blog-text">
                        The ESG Scorecard Model evaluates a company’s performance based on three crucial environmental, social, and governance parameters. These parameters include a broad range of factors. The environmental criteria measure a company’s stewardship of the environment, including waste management, pollution, energy use, and adherence to environmental laws. The social criteria assess how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates, considering factors like labour practices, community engagement, and charitable activities. 


                      </p>

                        <p class="blog-text">
                          The governance criteria involve an examination of a company’s leadership, transparency, shareholder rights, audits, and internal controls.

                          Benefits of the ESG Scorecard Model The ESG Scorecard Model offers many benefits. It can help investors identify potential environmental, social, and governance risks which could affect a company’s financial performance or reputation. Moreover, it serves as a performance indicator, given that strong ESG performance often correlates with sound operational performance. 

                        </p>

                        <p class="blog-text">
                          The scorecard assists with communicating a company’s dedication to sustainability, which can attract investors and customers. It also helps to show compliance with stricter ESG regulations around the world. This promotes transparency in business practices.

                            Risk Mitigation: By providing a thorough analysis of a company’s ESG performance, the Scorecard Model allows investors and stakeholders to identify and manage potential risks in environmental, social, and governance areas that could impact a company’s financial standing or reputation.

                          ESG Scorecard Models have many benefits but also face challenges due to lack of standardization. Differences in evaluation can lead to subjectivity, causing biases and discrepancies. High scores don’t always indicate a positive impact, as self-reported ESG data can be inconsistent or inaccurate.

                          Understanding industry priorities is important for evaluating ESG factors. Agencies like Sustainalytics, Moody’s, Bloomberg, S&P, and MSCI provide ESG Scorecards and Rating models. These models prioritize key features like objectivity, transparency, comparability, accountability, and integration. The ESG Scorecard is a detailed approach that meets these requirements.

                          For instance, environmental factors like greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity impacts carry substantial weight in industries like oil and gas. Conversely, the technology sector may prioritize governance issues like data privacy and security. The ESG Scorecard Model efficiently captures these differences, offering a more detailed and industry-specific analysis than broad ESG Ratings.

                          Considering industry- and country-specific risks is essential while constructing an ESG scorecard model. For instance, an industry like oil and gas presents significant environmental risks related to carbon emissions and potential oil spills. At the same time, the technology sector might grapple more with social risks like data privacy and fair labour practices.
                        </p>

                        <p class="blog-text">
                          Country-specific risks pertain to a particular country’s political, economic, and social environment. Countries with stringent environmental regulations may spur companies to perform better in environmental criteria. Conversely, regions with weak labour rights protection could present substantial social risks.

                        <p class="blog-text">
                          These risk considerations are typically integrated into the ESG Scorecard model through the concept of ‘beta (β). β measures risk arising from exposure to general market movements, but in the context of ESG analysis, it may be fine-tuned to encapsulate industry and country-specific risks. Consequently, two types of betas are considered: industry-specific and country-specific.
                        </p>


                        
                        <p class="blog-text">
                          Industry-specific beta (β) measures a company’s sensitivity to its industry’s overall performance, while country-specific beta reflects a company’s sensitivity to the economic and political climate in the countries where it operates. This integration of adjusted beta makes the ESG Scorecard model more robust, capturing the multifaceted nature of ESG risks, leading to a more nuanced and accurate ESG score. This comprehensive score aids investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

                        For the past few years, a data revolution of epic proportions has changed the way businesses think and function. Recommendation Insights and Foreseeing Demand from large data sets are some of the trends featuring in the world market. PM Modi remarks on a recently concluded RAISE 2020 summit declared India as a potential for “rising power in the field of Artificial Intelligence”, for creating a robust AI infrastructure and roadmap in the world.

                        AI research is expensive and requires a lot of investment in building cutting-edge processors and research facilities. Although Indian AI market for start-ups attracted $762.5 million in 2019 as per reports, Globally, India is far behind in AI adoption. India has just two of supercomputers out of 500 best supercomputers in the world (226 of which are in China, and 113 in the US). Therefore, govt with its AIRAWAT initiative is planning to build a series of supercomputers, modelled after the Summit and ABCI facilities in the US and Japan, respectively.

                          India’s resolve to successfully leverage AI to solve various developmental challenges will not just transform the lives but also the market, which for the year 2021 AI predicted at $6.8 Bn (6.6% growth rate). From 2021 to 2025, the CAGR for the entire AI market to grow at 13.8%. However, the pace of growth for the period 2020-2021 will be slower than the average rate of growth for the period 2021-2025. This slower growth for the upcoming year is because of the recessionary and stalled effects caused by the unfortunate timing of the pandemic. AI could play a significant role in not just COVID-19 response but also faster recovery of the ailing economy, by supporting social and equitable growth.
